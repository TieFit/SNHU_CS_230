1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Gaming Room was a client that already had a game called "Draw It Or Lose It". This was already developed on Android. They wanted to move this into becoming a web-based gaming application that could work on multiple different systems. 

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

 I believe one thing I did well through developing this document was keeping the current state of the client's development team in mind when creating it. As the application was only on Android and they wished to scale its scope, this would require their current team to learn new technologies.   


3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

One thing that was helpful was how working through a design document made it easier to envision the full range of the code being developed. The design document sets the requirements needed for the application and gives a guide in developing the actual code. 

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One part I would revise would be the development requirements section in the design document. I'll be honest, I did not wish to repeat myself and simply say to use technologies that would be usable across different operating systems. So instead I rambled to fulfill the assignment requirements.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It's important to consider the user's needs because they are the the one that you are designing the software for. 

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I took into consideration the client's requests and needs and gave suggestions based upon that and what technologies or practices would be best.
